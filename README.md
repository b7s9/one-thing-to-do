# One Thing to Do

## Problem

Todo lists are a helpful way of organizing the tasks that you need and/or want to do, but for people with ADHD/ADD, it can often be very difficult to actually find the motivation to check an item off that list. When the list gets too long, it can feel especially overwhelming.

## Solution

One of the most effective means of self-motivation I've discovered is regular self-affirmations. By lifting your spirits, it's much easier to move that energy and apply it to something totally unrelatedâ€”like Newton's law of emotion or something.

This project is a webapp that requires you to say something nice about yourself every time you want to add a new item to your todo list. Rather than view all of your todos at once in a daunting list, the todo viewer picks a random one to show you, but also picks a random affirmation to display right beneath it. This way the user experience is more focused and kinder than a standard to do list ðŸ’š

## Developer Installation

Progressive Web Apps must be served over https, so you will need to serve the project on localhost, as opposed to just opening `index.html` in your browser. I've included an npm package for your convenience, or you can use your own e.g. MAMP.

```bash
git clone https://b7s9/one-thing-to-do.git
cd one-thing-to-do
npm install
npm start
```

if you haven't already done so, install [node/npm LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. clone this project locally
1. switch into this project's directory
1. install this project's dependencies
1. start the development server, available on http://localhost:8080
